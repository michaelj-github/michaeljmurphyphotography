    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="../images/about-photo.jpg" alt="Michael J Murphy">
    <p>Hello, I’m Michael J Murphy, a passionate nature and bird photographer based in Cincinnati, Ohio. My mission is to capture moments of tranquility and natural beauty to share with others and inspire appreciation for the outdoors.</p>
    <p>My camera is an OM SYSTEM OM-1 Mark II with a 12-40mm f/2.8 Lens. I'm just learning how to use it and I'm eager to get a telephoto zoom lens for longer shots of birds. I'm looking at the M.Zuiko 100-400mm F5-6.3 IS as it looks like a great lens and a moderate price.</p>
